# Movie_Tracker
Python 3 application using tkinter and sqlite DB.  

This sample application maintains data in a database using a simple GUI and allows for custom SQL operations (DML).  The context of the application is a movie tracker where you can enter movies you've watched, including actors in the movies.  This allows for the database to be searchable for such things as all the movies you've watched which were of a certain genre, or which included certain actors, or were released in a certain year.

#### Tables in DB
- Movie
- Actor
- Movie_Actor
- Genre

These are the table names which can be used in the custom SQL feature.

#### Libraries used
- tkinter
- sqlite3
- pandas
